                    <p class="mb-4">AIK7 Inc. (“Aik7”) operates the aiK7.com website (the “Site”) and the mobile application (the “App”). AIK7 serves as manager to AIK7 Properties LLC, AIK7 Properties Plus LLC and AIK7 Properties Advanced LLC, and such companies shall be collectively referred to herein as “Aik7 Properties”. Neither AIK7 nor AIK7 Properties is a broker-dealer or an investment advisor. Dalmore Group LLC, a registered broker-dealer and member FINRA and SIPC, located at 525 Green Place, Woodmere, NY 11598, is the broker-dealer of record for AIK7, an issuer direct offering, information on all FINRA-registered broker-dealers can be found on FINRA’s BrokerCheck.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">Investing in securities involves risks, and there is always the potential of losing money when you invest in securities. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investments such as those on the AIK7 platform are speculative and involve substantial risks to consider before investing, outlined in the respective offering materials and including, but not limited to, illiquidity, lack of diversification, and complete loss of capital. An investment in an offering constitutes only an investment in a particular series and not in AIK7 or any of the underlying asset(s). Investors should carefully review the risks located in the respective offering materials for a more comprehensive discussion of risks.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">You should speak with your financial advisor, accountant and/or attorney when evaluating any offering. Neither AIK7 nor Dalmore makes any recommendations or provides advice about investments, and no communication through the Site, the App, or in any other medium, should be construed as a recommendation for any security offered or off this investment platform. The Site and/or the App may make forward-looking statements. You should not rely on these statements but should carefully evaluate the offering materials in assessing any investment opportunity, including the complete set of risk factors that are provided as part of the offering circular for your consideration. Find the applicable offering circular for AIK7 Properties Plus LLC is available base, and for AIK7 Properties Advanced LLC base.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">From time to time, AIK7 will seek to qualify additional series offerings of securities under regulation A. For offerings that have not yet been qualified, no money or other consideration is being solicited and, if sent in response, will not be accepted. No offer to buy securities of a particular offering can be accepted, and no part of the purchase price can be received, until an offering statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) relating to that series has been qualified by the SEC. Any such offer may be withdrawn or revoked, without obligation or commitment of any kind.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Investment overviews contained on the Site and/or the App contain summaries of the purpose and the principal business terms of the investment opportunities. Such summaries are intended for informational purposes only and do not purport to be complete, and each is qualified in its entirety by reference to the more detailed discussions contained in the applicable offering circular filed with the SEC. Ark7 does not offer refunds after an investment has been made. Please review the relevant offering materials and subscription documentation for more information.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">All securities (“Shares”) will be issued in electronic form only and will not be listed or quoted on any securities exchange. We expect that after a series’ offering has concluded, the Public Private Execution Network Alternative Trading System, or PPEX ATS (the “Secondary Trading Platform”), which is registered with the SEC and operated by North Capital Private Securities Corporation (“North Capital”), will be a venue available for the resale of such Shares through Dalmore, as a broker-dealer member of the Secondary Trading Platform; provided, however, any such resale of Shares will be subject to federal and state securities laws and the restrictions in the series’ Operating Agreement, and there can be no assurance that an active market for any Shares will develop on the Secondary Trading Platform, that the Secondary Trading Platform will be available to allow resales of Shares to residents of all states, or that the Secondary Trading Platform will be available at all. For these reasons, investors must be prepared to hold their Shares indefinitely.</p>
